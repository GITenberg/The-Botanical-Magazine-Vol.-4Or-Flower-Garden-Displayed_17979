<p>Our plant is undoubtedly the <i>Spanish blush Mallow</i> of
<span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, and the <i>Lavatera alth&aelig;&aelig;folia</i> of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>
according to the former, it is a native of Spain, according to the
latter, of Syria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span> considers it as distinct from the <i>trimestris</i>; Mr.
<span class="smcap">Aiton</span> has no <i>alth&aelig;&aelig;folia</i> in his <i>Hort. Kew.</i> we are therefore
to conclude that the <i>alth&aelig;&aelig;folia</i> of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, and the
<i>trimestris</i> of <span class="smcap">Linneus</span> are one and the same species.</p>

<p>Of the annuals commonly raised in our gardens, this is one of the most
shewy, as well as the most easily cultivated; its seeds are to be sown
in March, on the borders where they are to remain, the plants, thinned
as they come up, and kept clear of weeds.</p>

<p>It varies with white blossoms, and flowers from July to September.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The radical leaves of plants usually differ in shape from those of the
stalk, in some plants remarkably so; the <i>Lepidium perfoliatum</i> figured
in the <i>Flora Austriaca</i> of Professor <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> is a striking
instance of this dissimilarity: the <i>Lathyrus Aphaca</i>, a British plant,
figured in the <i>Flora Lond.</i> is still more such, as large entire
leaf-like stipul&aelig; grow in pairs on the stalk, instead of leaves, while
the true leaves next the root, visible when the plant first comes up
from seed, are few in number, and those pinnated. The present plant no
less admirably illustrates the above remark, the leaves which first
appear on the seedling plants being pinnated, as is represented in the
small figure on the plate, while those which afterwards come forth grow
in whorls. We have observed the same disposition to produce dissimilar
leaves in several other species of <i>Mimosa</i>, which have arisen from
Botany-Bay seeds, lately introduced.</p>

<p>This singular species, on the authority of Mr. <span class="smcap">David Nelson</span>, is
a native of New South Wales, and was introduced to the royal garden at
Kew by Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>, Bart.</p>

<p>We first saw it in flower, and have since seen it with ripe seed-pods,
at Mr. <span class="smcap">Malcolm</span>'s, Kennington.</p>

<p>It is properly a green-house plant, and propagated only by seeds, which
are to be sown on a gentle hot-bed.</p>

<p>It is some years in arriving at its flowering state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Grows spontaneously in various parts of France and Germany; Mr.
<span class="smcap">Philip Hurlock</span> lately shewed me some dried specimens of this
plant, which he gathered in the corn fields, on the <i>Luneburgh Heide</i>,
in <i>Upper Lusatia</i>, where it grew plentifully, and afforded a pleasing
appearance to the curious traveller:&mdash;not so to the husbandman, to whom
it is as noxious as the <i>Convolvulus arvensis</i> (<i>small Bindweed</i>) is
with us, and equally difficult to extirpate, having powerfully creeping
roots, which somewhat like the <i>Helianthus tuberosus</i> (commonly called
<i>Jerusalem Artichoke</i>) produce large tubera, and which like those of
that plant, are in high esteem with some as an article of food, and as
such even cultivated abroad.</p>

<p>It flowers from June to the end of August. It is certainly a beautiful
hardy perennial, similar to (but of more humble growth) than the
everlasting pea, yet must be cautiously introduced on account of its
creeping roots, by which it is most readily propagated, rarely ripening
its seeds with us.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, better suited to decorate the unclip'd hedge of the
pleasure-ground, than the border of the flower-garden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most ornamental hardy shrubs we possess; at once pleasing to
the eye, and grateful to the smell; for, as <span class="smcap">Miller</span> observes,
the whole plant in warm weather exudes a sweet glutinous substance,
which has a very strong balsamic scent, so as to perfume the
circumambient air to a great distance.</p>

<p>Its blossoms, which appear in June and July in great profusion, exhibit
a remarkable instance of quickly-fading beauty, opening and expanding to
the morning sun, and before night strewing the ground with their elegant
remains: as each succeeding day produces new blossoms, this deciduous
disposition of the petals, common to the genus, is the less to be
regretted.</p>

<p>Is a native of Spain and Portugal, prefers a dry soil and warm sheltered
situation, and in very severe seasons requires some kind of covering.</p>

<p>Cultivated 1656, by Mr. <span class="smcap">John Tradescant</span>, jun. <i>Ait. Hort. Kew.</i></p>

<p>Is readily increased from cuttings; but <span class="smcap">Miller</span> remarks, that
the best plants are raised from seeds.</p>

<p>Varies with waved leaves, and in having petals without a spot at the
base.</p>

<p>Is not the plant from whence the Ladanum of the shops is produced,
though affording in warmer countries than ours a similar gum, hence its
name of <i>ladanifera</i> is not strictly proper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is an annual plant which grows naturally in Asia and America, but has
been long cultivated for ornament in the English gardens, and is
generally known by the title of Convolvulus major. Of this there are
three or four lasting varieties; the most common hath a purple flower,
but there is one with a white, another with a red, and one with a
whitish-blue flower, which hath white seeds. All these varieties I have
cultivated many years, without observing them to change. If the seeds of
these sorts are sown in the spring, upon a warm border where the plants
are designed to remain, they will require no other culture but to keep
them clear from weeds, and place some tall stakes down by them, for
their stalks to twine about, otherwise they will spread on the ground
and make a bad appearance. These plants, if they are properly supported,
will rise ten or twelve feet high in warm Summers: they flower in June,
July, and August, and will continue till the frost kills them. Their
seeds ripen in Autumn." <i>Miller's Gard. Dict. ed. 4to. 1771.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>Grows spontaneously in Sicily and Crete; is an annual of humble growth,
and hence a suitable plant for the borders of the flower garden, or the
decoration of Rock-work, as its blossoms are shewy, and not of very
short duration.</p>

<p>A native of France, Spain, and Italy, and distinguishable when in flower
by the blue colour of its blossoms, which are sometimes, however,
milk-white; but its seed-pods afford a more certain mark of distinction,
being unusually short, broad, and winged on the back.</p>

<p>This species grows to the height of about two feet, and is usually sown
in the spring with other annuals; though not so beautiful, it forms a
contrast to the sweet and Tangier Pea, and may be introduced where there
is plenty of room, or a desire of possessing and knowing most of the
plants of a genus.</p>

<p>It flowers in June and July.</p>

<p>For this rare plant I am indebted to the very laudable exertions of a
late Gardener of mine, <span class="smcap">James Smith</span>, who, in the spring of the
year 1788, examining attentively the bog earth which had been brought
over with some plants of the <i>Dion&aelig;a Muscipula</i>, found several small
tooth-like knobby roots, which being placed in pots of the same earth,
and plunged into a tan-pit having a gentle heat, produced plants the
ensuing summer, two of which flowered, and from the strongest of those
our figure was taken.</p>

<p>From this circumstance we learn, that this species is a native of South
Carolina, and properly a bog plant, growing spontaneously with the
<i>Dion&aelig;a Muscipula</i>.</p>

<p>Both Mr. <span class="smcap">Dryander</span> and Dr. <span class="smcap">J. E. Smith</span> assure me, that
it is the true <i>Limodorum tuberosum</i> of <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>; the one
usually called by that name is a native of the West-Indies, and treated
as a stove plant.</p>

<p>From the little experience we have had of the management of this
species, it appears to us to be scarcely hardy enough for the open
border, yet not tender enough to require a stove. We have succeeded best
by treating it in the manner above mentioned; we may observe, that the
tan-pit spoken of was built in the open garden, not in a stove, and was
for the purpose of raising plants or seeds by a gentle heat, as well as
for striking cuttings and securing plants from cold in the winter.</p>

<p>Our figure will make a description of the plant unnecessary, its
flowering stem with us has arisen to the height of a foot and a half,
the number of flowers has not exceeded five. In its most luxuriant state
it will probably be found much larger, and to produce more flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>This species of Bell-flower, which takes its name from its place of
growth, is a native of the Carpatian Alps, and was introduced into the
Royal Garden at Kew, by <i>Professor</i> <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span>, of <i>Vienna</i>, in
the year 1774.</p>

<p>It flowers in June and July.</p>

<p>As yet it is scarce in our gardens, but deserves to be more generally
known and cultivated; its flowers, in proportion to the plant, are large
and shewy: like many other Alpine plants, it is well suited to decorate
certain parts of rock-work, or such borders of the flower garden, as are
not adapted for large plants.</p>

<p>It is a hardy perennial, and propagated by parting its roots in autumn.</p>

inadequate idea of its beauty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Grows spontaneously out of the crevices of the rocks in the South of
France; flowers in our gardens in July and August; is a very hardy
perennial, and in sheltered situations retains its leaves all the year.</p>

<p>The singular manner in which the leaves are attached to the flowering
stem, deserves to be noticed.</p>

<p>As many of the succulent plants are tender, and require a Green-house in
the winter, cultivators of plants are apt indiscriminately to extend the
same kind of care to the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> tribe, hence it is not uncommon to find
this and many other similar hardy plants, nursed up in the Green-house
or stove, when they would thrive much better on a wall or piece of
rock-work, for the decoration of which this plant in particular is
admirably adapted.</p>

<p>In order that we may give our readers an opportunity of seeing a
coloured representation of one of the most scarce and magnificent plants
introduced into this country, we have this number deviated from our
usual plan, with respect to the plates, and though in so doing we shall
have the pleasure of gratifying the warm wishes of many of our readers,
we are not without our apprehensions least others may not feel perfectly
well satisfied; should it prove so, we wish such to rest assured that
this is a deviation in which we shall very rarely indulge and never but
when something uncommonly beautiful or interesting presents itself: to
avoid the imputation of interested motives, we wish our readers to be
apprized that the expences attendant on the present number, in
consequence of such deviation, have been considerably <i>augmented</i>, not
lowered.</p>

<p>It is well known to many Botanists, and others, who have experienced Sir
<span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>'s well known liberality, that previous to the
publication of the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i> he made a new genus of this plant,
which had before been considered as a species of <i>Heliconia</i>, and named
it <i>Strelitzia</i> in honour of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> most gracious Queen
<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span>; coloured engravings of which, executed under his
direction, he presented to his particular friends; impressions of the
same plate have been given in the aforesaid work, in which we are
informed that this plant was introduced to the royal garden at Kew, by
Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>, Bart. in the year 1773, where it lately
flowered&mdash;of some other plants introduced after that period from the
Cape, of which it is a native, one flowered in the Pine stove of
<span class="smcap">Bamber Gascoyne</span>, Esq. several years ago, from whence Mr.
<span class="smcap">Millar</span> drew his figure, and the plant from which our drawing
was made flowered this spring, in the bark stove of the garden belonging
to the Apothecaries Company, at Chelsea, where it will also soon flower
again.</p>

<p>This plant has usually been confined to the stove, where it has been
placed in a pot, and plunged into the tan, as the plants in such
situations usually are; it has been found that when the roots have been
confined to the narrow limits of a pot, the plant has rarely or never
flowered, but that when the roots have by accident extended into the
rotten tan, it has readily thrown up flowering stems, the best practice
therefore, not only with this, but many other plants, is to let the
roots have plenty of earth to strike into. As it is a Cape plant it may
perhaps be found to succeed best in the conservatory.</p>

<p>It has not, that we know of, as yet ripened its seeds in this country;
till it does, or good seeds of it shall be imported, it must remain a
very scarce and dear plant, as it is found to increase very slowly by
its roots: plants are said to be sold at the Cape for Three Guineas
each.</p>

<p class='center'><i>General Description of the STRELITZIA REGIN&AElig;.</i></p>

<p>From a perennial stringy root shoot forth a considerable number of
leaves, standing upright on long footstalks, front a sheath of some one
of which, near its base, springs the flowering stem, arising somewhat
higher than the leaves, and terminating in an almost horizontal
long-pointed spatha, containing about six or eight flowers, which
becoming vertical as they spring forth, form a kind of crest, which the
glowing orange of the Corolla, and fine azure of the Nectary, renders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
truly superb. The outline in the third plate of this number, is intended
to give our readers an idea of its general habit and mode of growth.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Particular Description of the same.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>ROOT perennial, stringy, somewhat like that of the tawny Day-lily
(Hemerocallis fulva); strings the thickness of the little finger,
blunt at the extremity, extending horizontally, if not confined,
to the distance of many feet.</p>

<p>LEAVES numerous, standing upright on their footstalks, about a foot in
length, and four inches in breadth, ovato-oblong, coriaceous,
somewhat fleshy, rigid, smooth, concave, entire on the edges,
except on one side towards the base, where they are more or less
curled, on the upper side of a deep green colour, on the under
side covered with a fine glaucous meal, midrib hollow above and
yellowish, veins unbranched, prominent on the inside, and
impressed on the outside of the leaf, young leaves rolled up.</p>

<p>LEAF-STALKS about thrice the length of the leaves, upright, somewhat
flattened, at bottom furnished with a sheath, and received into
each other, all radical.</p>

<p>SCAPUS or flowering stem unbranched, somewhat taller than the leaves,
proceeding from the sheath of one of them, upright, round, not
perfectly straight, nearly of an equal thickness throughout, of a
glaucous hue, covered with four or five sheaths which closely
embrace it. Two or more flowering stems spring from the same root,
according to the age of the plant.</p>

<p>SPATHA terminal, about six inches in length, of a glaucous hue, with a
fine bright purple at its base, running out to a long point,
opening above from the base to within about an inch of the apex,
where the edges roll over to one side, forming an angle of about
forty-five degrees, and containing about six flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>FLOWERS of a bright orange colour, becoming upright, when perfectly
detached from the spatha, which each flower is a considerable time
in accomplishing. In the plant at Chelsea, the two back petals,
or, more properly segments of the first flower, sprang forth with
the nectary, and while the former became immediately vertical, the
latter formed nearly the same angle as the spatha; four days
afterwards the remaining segment of the first flower, with the two
segments and nectary of the second came forth, and in the same
manner at similar intervals all the flowers, which were six in
number, continued to make their appearance.</p>

<p>COROLLA deeply divided into three segments, which are ovato-lanceolate,
slightly keeled, and somewhat concave, at the base white, fleshy,
and covered with a glutinous substance flowing in great quantities
from the nectary.</p>

<p>NECTARY of a fine azure blue and most singular form, composed of two
petals, the upper petal very short and broad, with a whitish mucro
or point, the sides of which lap over the base of the other petal;
inferior petal about two inches and a half in length, the lower
half somewhat triangular, grooved on the two lowermost sides, and
keeled at bottom, the keel running straight to its extremity, the
upper half gradually dilating towards the base, runs out into two
lobes more or less obtuse, which give it an arrow-shaped form,
bifid at the apex, hollow, and containing the anther&aelig;, the edges
of the duplicature crisped and forming a kind of frill from the
top to the bottom.</p>

<p>STAMINA five Filaments arising from the base of the nectary, short and
distinct; Anther&aelig; long and linear, attached to and cohering by
their tips to the apex of the nectary.</p>

<p>STYLE filiform, white, length of the nectary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>STIGMA three quarters of an inch long, attached to, and hitched on as it
were to the tip of the nectary, roundish, white, awl-shaped, very
viscid, becoming as the flower decays of a deep purple brown
colour, and usually splitting into three pieces, continuing
attached to the nectary till the nectary decays.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fairbairn</span>, to whose abilities and industry the Companies
Garden at Chelsea is indebted for its present flourishing state, being
desirous of obtaining ripe seeds, I had no opportunity of examining the
germen.</p>

<p>Such were the appearances which presented themselves to us in the plant
which flowered at the Chelsea Garden; that they are liable to
considerable variation is apparent from the figure of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Millar</span>, which appears to have been drawn from a very luxuriant
specimen, as two spath&aelig; grow from one flowering stem, the stigma is also
remarkably convoluted, many other appearances are likewise represented,
which our plant did not exhibit: in the figure given in the <i>Hortus
Kewensis</i>, the stigma appears to have separated from the nectary on the
first opening of the flower, and to be split into three parts, neither
of which circumstances took place in our plant till they were both in a
decaying state.</p>

<i>incomparabilis</i> of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>'s <i>Dict. ed. 6. 4to.</i> the latter
informs us, that he received roots of it from Spain and Portugal, which
fixes its place of growth.</p>

<p>It is a very hardy bulbous plant, and flowers in April; in its single
state it is very ornamental, the petals are usually pale yellow, and the
nectary inclined to orange, which towards the brim is more brilliant in
some than in others; in its double state, it is well known to Gardeners,
by the name of Butter and Egg Narcissus, and of this there are two
varieties, both of which produce large shewy flowers, the one with
colours similar to what we have above described, which is the most
common, the other with petals of a pale sulphur colour, almost white,
and the nectary bright orange; this, which is one of the most ornamental
of the whole tribe, is named in the Dutch catalogues, the <i>Orange
Ph&oelig;nix</i>; its blossoms are so large as frequently to require
supporting; its bulbs may be had of many of the Nurseries about London,
and of those who, profiting by the supineness of our English Gardeners,
import bulbs from abroad.</p>

<p>Like most of the tribe, this species will grow well without any care,
the bulbs of the double sort should be taken up yearly, otherwise they
are apt to degenerate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Hyacinthus racemosus</i> and <i>botryoides</i> are both cultivated in
gardens, but the former here figured is by far the most common;
<i>racemosus</i> and <i>botryoides</i>, though different words, are expressive of
the same meaning, the former being derived from the Latin term
<i>racemus</i>, the latter from the Greek one &#946;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#965;&#987;, both of which
signify a bunch of grapes, the form of which the inflorescence of these
plants somewhat resembles, and hence they have both been called Grape
Hyacinths, but as confusion thereby arises, we have thought it better to
call this species the Starch Hyacinth, the smell of the flower in the
general opinion resembling that substance, and leave the name of Grape
Hyacinth for the <i>botryoides</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hyacinthus racemosus</i> grows wild in the corn fields of Germany, in
which it increases so fast by offsets from the root as to prove a very
troublesome weed, and on this account it must be cautiously introduced
into gardens.</p>

<p>It flowers in April and May.</p>

<p>We have found the Nurserymen very apt to mistake it for the
<i>botryoides</i>, a figure of which it is our intention to give in some
future number.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>We are more and more convinced, that in our eagerness, for novelties, we
daily lose plants by far more ornamental than the new ones we introduce;
the present, a most charming spring plant, with which the Gardens
abounded in the time of <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, is now a great rarity; its
blossoms, which are uncommonly brilliant, come forth in April, and, like
those of many other plants, appear to advantage only when the sun
shines.</p>

<p>It may be propagated either by seeds, or by parting its roots in Autumn,
in the former way we may obtain many beautiful varieties.</p>

<p>It prefers a light loamy soil and moderately exposed situation.</p>

<p>Roots of a variety of this plant with scarlet double flowers are
imported from Holland, under the name, of <i>Anemonoides</i>, and sold at a
high price.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The flowers of this plant, a native of Gibraltar, bear some resemblance
to those of the Common Candy-Tuft, but when they blow in perfection,
they are usually twice as large; hence they are highly ornamental in the
green-house, which early in the Spring, the time of their coming forth,
stands in need of some such shewy flowers.</p>

<p>This plant is easily raised from cuttings, and easily preserved; it may
be kept through the Winter in a common hot-bed frame, and in mild
Winters will stand abroad, especially if sheltered amongst rock-work;
its greatest enemy is moisture in the Winter season, this often proves
fatal to it, as indeed a long continued damp atmosphere does to many
others; the Nurserymen about London complain of losing more plants the
last mild Winter, from this cause, than they generally do from severe
frosts. In a little green-house which I had in my late garden,
Lambeth-Marsh, most of the plants became absolutely mouldy; in such
seasons then, though in point of cold the plants may not require it, we
must dissipate the superfluous moisture by a gentle heat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>This plant receives its generic name from <span class="smcap">Claudius Alstr&oelig;mer</span>
(son of Sir <span class="smcap">Jonas Alstr&oelig;mer</span>, a most respectable Swedish
Merchant) who first found the other most beautiful species the
<i>Pelegrina</i> in Spain, whither it had been transmitted from Peru; its
trivial name <i>Ligtu</i> is a provincial one.</p>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Fewillee</span>, who has written on the plants of Peru,
this species is found on the banks of the rivers in Chili: we treat it,
and successfully, as a stove plant; its flowers, which usually make
their appearance in February and March, emit a fragrance scarcely
inferior to Mignonet; its leaves, contrary to most others, grow
inverted, which is effected by a twist of the footstalk, and afford an
excellent example of <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>'s <i>Folium resupinatum</i>; the
filaments, after the pollen is discharged, turn upwards, and the anther&aelig;
become almost globular.</p>

<p>It is usually propagated by parting its roots in Autumn.</p>

<p>Plants which flower early, and continue a long while in bloom, are
deservedly preferred, more especially by those who content themselves
with a partial collection; of that number is the present species of
Alyssum, which begins to flower in March, and continues to blossom
through April, May, and June, and, if favourably situated, during most
of the summer.</p>

<p>It is properly a rock plant, being hardy, forming with very little care
a neat tuft of flowers, and not apt to encroach on its neighbours.</p>

<p>May be propagated by parting its roots in Autumn, or by cuttings.</p>

<p>The one here figured appears to be a variety of the <i>flexuosa</i> with a
purple eye, its blossoms are fragrant, and come forth in April or May.</p>

<p>"All the sorts multiply very fast by offsets, so that when once
obtained, there will be no occasion to raise them from seeds: for the
roots put out offsets in great plenty, most of which will flower the
following season, whereas those from seeds are three or four years
before they flower. These plants will not thrive through the winter in
the full ground in England, so must be planted in pots, and placed under
a frame in winter, where they may be protected from frost, but in mild
weather should enjoy the free air; but they must be guarded from mice,
who are very fond of these roots, and if not prevented will devour
them." <i>Millers Gard. Dict.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>There are few old gardens which do not abound with this plant; it bears
great affinity to our Hare-bell, with which it appears to have been
confounded by most Botanists. <i>Parkinson</i> thus discriminates it: "This
Spanish bell-flowred Jacinth is very like the former English or Spanish
Jacinth, but greater in all parts, as well of leaves as flowers, many
growing together at the toppe of the stalke; with many short greene
leaves among them, hanging doune their heads with larger, greater, and
wider open mouths, like unto bels of a darke blew colour, and no good
sent." <i>Park. Parad.</i></p>

<p>Though not remarkable for the fineness of its colours, or pleasing from
its fragrance, it contributes with other bulbous plants to decorate the

ripen well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this genus there is only one species described by authors, and which
<span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> has named in honour of our countryman <span class="smcap">Mark
Catesby</span>, Author of the Natural History of Carolina.</p>

<p>"This shrub was discovered by Mr. <span class="smcap">Catesby</span>, near Nassau-town, in
the Island of Providence, where he saw two of them growing, which were
all he ever saw; from these he gathered the seeds and brought them to
England.</p>

<p>"It is propagated by seeds, which must be procured from the country
where it naturally grows. If the entire fruit are brought over in sand,
the seeds will be better preserved; the seeds must be sown in small pots
filled with light sandy earth, and plunged into a moderate hot-bed of
Tanner's-bark. If the seeds are good, the plants will appear in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> about
six weeks; these plants make little progress for four or five years. If
the nights should prove cold the glasses must be covered with mats every
evening. As these plants grow slowly, so they will not require to be
removed out of the seed-pots the first year, but in the Autumn the pots
should be removed into the stove, and plunged into the tan-bed; in
spring the plants should be carefully taken up, and each planted in a
separate small pot, filled with light sandy earth, and plunged into a
fresh hot-bed of Tanner's-bark. In Summer when the weather is warm, they
should have a good share of air admitted to them, but in Autumn must be
removed into the stove; where they should constantly remain, and must be
treated afterwards in the same manner as other tender exotic plants."
<i>Miller's Dict.</i></p>

<p>It is more usual with Nurserymen to increase this plant by cuttings.</p>

<p>Our drawing was made from a plant which flowered this Spring, with Mr.
<span class="smcap">Colvill</span>, Nurseryman, King's-Road, Chelsea.</p>

<p>It flowers most part of the Summer, but not so freely as many other
stove-plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rubus arcticus grows wild in the northern parts of Europe and
America, in moist, sandy, and gravelly places. <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> has
figured and minutely described it in his <i>Flora Lapponica</i>, out of
gratitude, as he expresses himself, for the benefits reaped from it in
his Lapland journey, by the nectareous wine of whose berries he was so
often recruited when sinking with hunger and fatigue; he observes that
the principal people in the north of Sweden make a syrup, a jelly, and a
wine, from the berries, which they partly consume themselves, and partly
transmit to Stockholm, as a dainty of the most delicious kind; and truly
he adds, of all the wild Swedish berries this holds the first place.</p>

<p>Our figure does not correspond altogether with <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>'s
description, but it is drawn as the plant grew; culture doubtless made
it produce more than its usual number of flowering stems and petals.</p>

<p>It grows readily and increases rapidly in bog-earth, on a north border,
and flowers in May and June, but very rarely ripens its fruit in
Gardens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the old Botanists arranged this plant, the <i>racemosus</i>, and
others having almost globular flowers with the Hyacinths.
<span class="smcap">Tournefort</span>, struck with the difference of their appearance,
made a distinct genus of them under the name of <i>Muscari</i>, in which he
is followed by <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, and should have been by
<span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>, for they differ so much that no student would consider
the present plant as belonging to the same genus with the Hare-bell.</p>

<p>This species grows wild in the corn-fields of Spain, Portugal, and some
parts of Germany, and flowers in May and June.</p>

<p>It is distinguished more by its singularity than beauty, the flowers on
the summit of the stalk differing widely in colour from the others, and
being mostly barren: <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> says, "the whole stalke with the
flowers upon it, doth somewhat resemble a long Purse tassell, and
thereupon divers Gentlewomen have so named it."</p>

<p>It is a hardy bulbous plant, growing readily in most soils and
situations, and usually propagated by offsets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this plant <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> makes two species, viz. the <i>vernalis</i>
and <i>appennina</i>, differing in their specific character merely in the
number of their petals, which are found to vary from situation and
culture; as the first name taken from its time of flowering is the most
expressive, we have followed Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>
in adopting it.</p>

<p>It is an old inhabitant of the English gardens, and a most desirable
one, as it flowers in the spring; produces fine shewy blossoms, which
expand wide when exposed to the sun, is hardy and readily cultivated.</p>

<p>Grows wild on the mountainous pastures of some parts of Germany.</p>

<p>It may be increased by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring, or by
seed. <span class="smcap">Miller</span> recommends the latter mode.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>This new species of Gladiolus, of whose magnificence our figure can
exhibit but an imperfect idea, was introduced into this country from
Holland, a few years since, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Graffer</span>, at present
Gardener to the King of Naples; and first flowered with Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Lewis</span> and <span class="smcap">Mackie</span>, Nurserymen, at Kingsland; a very
strong plant of it flowered also this summer at Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Grimwoods</span> and Co. which divided at top into three branches,
from one of which our figure was drawn.</p>

<p>It obviously differs from the other more tender plants of this genus, in
the colour of its flowers, which are of a fine scarlet, with large white
somewhat rhomboidal spots, on several of the lowermost divisions of the
Corolla; strong plants will throw up a stem three or four feet high.</p>

<p>It is most probably a native of the Cape, flowers with us in July and
August, and is increased by offsets from the bulbs; must be treated like
the Ixias and other similar Cape plants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>A vein of singularity runs through the whole of this plant, its stalks
are unequally and obtusely quadrangular, sometimes more evidently
triangular; its leaves few, and remarkably small; its flowers, on the
contrary, are uncommonly large, and what is more extraordinary have only
four petals; previous to their expansion they exhibit also an appearance
somewhat outr&egrave;, the body of the filaments being bent so as to form a
kind of bow, in which state we have represented one of the blossoms in
our figure.</p>

<p>When it flowers in perfection, which it is not apt to do in all places,
the largeness of its blossoms renders it one of the most ornamental of
the genus.</p>

<p>There is a variety of it with beautifully coloured leaves, of which we
have availed ourselves in its representation.</p>

<p>It flowers from June, to August, and September; requires the same
treatment as the more common Geraniums, and is readily propagated by
cuttings.</p>

<p>This new species of Kalmia which we have called <i>hirsuta,</i> the stalk,
leaves, and calyx, being covered with strong hairs, was imported from
Carolina in the Spring of 1790, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span>, Nurseryman at
Islington, with whom several plants of it flowered this present Autumn,
about the middle of September, from one of which our drawing was made.</p>

<p>The plants were brought over with their roots enclosed in balls of the
earth in which they naturally grew, which on being examined appeared of
a blackish colour, and full of glittering particles of sand; similar
indeed to the bog-earth which we find on our moors and heaths; there is
therefore little doubt (for no account accompanied the plants) but this
Kalmia grows on moorish heaths, or in swamps.</p>

<p>In its general appearance it bears some resemblance to the <i>Andromeda
Dab&oelig;cii</i>; from the specimens we have seen its usual height would
appear to be from two to three feet; it grows upright; the flowers which
are about the size of those of the <i>Kalmia glauca</i>, are of a purple
colour, and contrary to all the other known Kalmia's grow in racemi.</p>

<p>It is propagated by layers, and requires the same treatment as the rest
of the genus, that is, to be planted in bog-earth, on a north border: as
this however is a new, and of course a dear plant, it will be most
prudent till we know what degree of cold it will bear, to keep it in a
pot of the same earth, plunged in the same situation, which may be
removed in the Winter to a green-house or hot-bed frame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Father <span class="smcap">Feuillee</span><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> figures and describes three species of
<i>Alstr&oelig;meria</i>, viz. <i>Pelegrina</i>, <i>Ligtu</i>, and <i>Salsilla</i>, common
names by which they are severally distinguished in Peru: the present
species, which is much valued by the natives on account of its beauty,
he informs us is found wild on a mountain to the north of, and a mile
distant from Lima.</p>

<p>From Peru, as might be expected, the present plant found its way into
Spain, from whence by the means of his beloved friend
<span class="smcap">Alstr&oelig;mer</span>, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> first received seeds of it; the
value he set on the acquisition is evident from the great care he took
of the seedling plants, preserving them through the winter in his
bed-chamber.</p>

<p>According to Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, this species was introduced to the
Royal Garden at Kew, by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Kennedy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, as
long ago as the year 1753.</p>

<p>Being a mountainous plant, it is found to be much more hardy than the
<i>Ligtu</i> already figured, and is generally treated as a green-house
plant; it is found, however, to flower and ripen its seeds better under
the glass of a hot-bed frame, where air is freely admitted.</p>

<p>It flowers from June to October, and, though a perennial, is generally
raised from seeds, yet may sometimes be increased by parting its roots,
which somewhat resemble those of the asparagus: the seeds should be sown
in the spring, in a pot of light earth, on a gentle hot-bed, either of
dung or tan.</p>

<p>The present, with many other species of Lupine, is very generally
cultivated in flower gardens, for the sake of variety, being usually
sown in the spring with other annuals; where the flower-borders are
spacious, they may with propriety be admitted, but as they take up much
room, and as their blossoms are of short duration, they are not so
desirable as many other plants.</p>

<p>It is a native of Sicily, and flowers in June and July.</p>

<p>We have often thought that the management of the kitchen garden, in
point of succession of crops, might be advantageously transplanted to
the flower garden; in the former, care is taken to have a regular
succession of the annual delicacies of the table, while in the latter, a
single sowing in the spring is thought to be all-sufficient; hence the
flower garden, which in August, September, and part of October, might be
covered with a profusion of bloom, exhibits little more than the decayed
stems of departed annuals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>This plant recommends itself by its fragrance rather than its beauty, so
delicious indeed is the odour it diffuses, that it is considered as
essential to every green-house and stove.</p>

<p>"It grows naturally in Peru, from whence the seeds were sent by the
younger Jussieu to the royal garden at Paris, where the plants produced
flowers and seeds; and from the curious garden of the Duke d'Ayen, at
St. Germain's, I was supplied with some of the seeds, which have
succeeded, in the Chelsea garden, where the plants have flowered and
perfected their seeds for some years." <i>Miller's Gard. Dict.</i></p>

<p>You may consider it either as a stove or a green-house plant, the former
is more congenial to it in the winter season.</p>

<p>A pure atmosphere is essential to its existence, as I experienced at
Lambeth-Marsh, where I in vain endeavoured to cultivate it.</p>

<p>It is propagated by cuttings as easily as any Geranium, and requires a
similar treatment; in hot weather it must be well supplied with water,
and in winter carefully guarded against frost, so fatal to most of the
natives of Peru.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>I am indebted for seeds of this plant to my very worthy and liberal
friend <span class="smcap">Nich. Gwyn</span>, M. D. of Ipswich, to whose penetrating
genius, and learned researches, Botany owes much.</p>

<p>As its name implies, it is a native of the province of Tangier, on the
Barbary coast; appears to have been cultivated here, according to the
<i>Hort. Kew.</i> in 1713, but is not mentioned in the 6th 4to. edit. of
<span class="smcap">Miller</span>'s Dictionary.</p>

<p>It may be considered as forming a valuable addition to our stock of
annuals, being a beautiful plant, and easily cultivated: it thrives best
on a moderately dry soil, warmly situated: should be sown in the spring
with other annuals.</p>

<p>I have observed, that in the middle of summer, a hot unclouded sun,
which is favourable to the expansion of most of the flowers of this
class, is too powerful for those of the present plant, which then appear
to the greatest advantage in warm hazy weather.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The leaves of this species exhibit, on being touched, a manifest
viscidity, or clamminess, which, independent of their shape, serves to
characterize the species; the middle of the leaf is also in general
stained with purple, which adds considerably to its beauty; but this
must be regarded rather as the mark of a variety, than of the species.</p>

<p>With most of its congeners, it is a native of the Cape, and of modern
date in this country, being introduced to the royal garden at Kew, by
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Kennedy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, in the year 1777.</p>

<p>It flowers from May to September; is readily propagated by cuttings, and
sometimes raised from seeds, from whence several varieties have been
produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The old Botanists appear to have been wonderfully at a loss to what
family they should refer this very singular plant, as will appear on
consulting the synonyms; <span class="smcap">Burman</span> at length made a distinct genus
of it, naming it <i>Ferraria</i> in honour of <span class="smcap">Joh.
Baptista Ferrarius</span>, by whom it was described, and very well
figured, in his <i>Flora feu de Florum Cultura</i>, published at Amsterdam,
in 1646.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span> informs us, that he received roots of this plant
from Dr. <span class="smcap">Job Baster</span>, F. R. S. of Zirkzee, who obtained it from
the Cape, of which it is a native.</p>

<p>In the vegetable line, it is certainly one of the most singular and
beautiful of nature's productions; much it is to be regretted that its
flowers are of very short duration, opening in the morning and finally
closing in the afternoon of the same day; a strong plant will, however,
throw out many blossoms in succession.</p>

<p>In its structure and &oelig;conomy, it approaches very near to the
<i>Sisyrinchium</i>.</p>

<p>It flowers very early in the spring, from February to May, and is
usually propagated by offsets, which its bulbs produce in tolerable
plenty. It requires a treatment similar to the Ixias and other Cape
bulbs. Our figure was drawn from a plant which flowered this spring, in
the possession of <span class="smcap">R. Forster</span>, Esq. of Turnham-Green.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
